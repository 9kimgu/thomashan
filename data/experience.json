        "summary":"During Summer of 2018, I had completed my internship program with Hyundai Merchant Marine. My experience at HMM was challenging but rewarding. I was able to experience different departments within the company which allowed me to be exposed to various fields and acquire new sets of skills and information. 
        The first project I was assigned to was learning about HMM's GAUS system which optimized vessel capacity and monitored  corporate bookings. The goal was to utilize space in the vessel and target any troubleshooting issues within the system.
        The second project I did was to use PIERs data to analyze commodities of other companies. The goal was to determine which company exported the most and apply that data to create a more efficient process.",
